### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fabrice (he/him), and I'm a student trying to become an experienced programmer ! In the past, I have worked as a programmer for a few Roblox games, founding Fmgroup Studios, which you can learn more about here : https://fmgroupstudios.com. I've got some experience with Lua, HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, Python and I'm currently experimenting Flutter to try to make some nice apps ! If you want to have a talk, just hit me up on my Twitter (X) or on my website, https://f-t.pw !

Have an amazing day, bye !
