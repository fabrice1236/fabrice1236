### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fabrice (he/him), and I'm a student trying to become an experienced programmer ! In the past, I have worked as a programmer for a few Roblox games, and co-founded Fmgroup Studios, which you can learn more about here : https://fm-group.be. I've got some experience with Lua, HTML, CSS, JS and I'm currently learning Ruby to try to make amazing web apps ! If you want to have talk, just hit me up on my Twitter or on my website, https://f-t.pw !

Have an amazing day, bye !
